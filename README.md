# es6-checkpointt
In this checkpoint i have done many challenges Kata in codewars using Javascript ES6 going through different levels of difficulty. Now talking about the challenges I did:
**150 points were earned from pre-selected problems, covering the basics (loop, conditional, data types, fundementals, arrays, objects, numbers, etc), which are 
all beginner level (providing 2 points per solution).
**More than 150 points were earned flexibly, I freely choose the problems to solve (different difficulties : 8kyu, 7kyu and 6 kyu).
